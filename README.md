ðŸ‘‹ Hi, We are @coralcommerce and we are a community of businesses linked through a common orchestration layer for payments and services routing globally.
One API (headless or hosted) to connect to multiple partners and clients around the world.

We are really keen to help large global brands easily navigate payments, 3rd party billing and value added service providers by connecting to our
API and use an ever expanding set of tools to connect and manage these partners effectively, reducing resources required and without having to learn
how to 'do payments'! Your business with our enbedded team and technology.

For payment companies who may be strong commercially, but not have the technical capability to run their own payment faciliation, our community have helped
us develop an excellent payfac service that can afford you your own CoralCommerce domain on which to run your own merchant portfolio and manage your own
payment gateway without needing to skill up on technical knowhow or weather payment integration pains. We do that part for you, as part of your team.

ðŸ‘€ We're happy to share the integrations here but we are more interested in hearing from partners and clients on how we can improve this experience.
So if you want to play around with the service you can use generic user credentials and hit up our sandbox for some fun. Anytime you have a query about
something, comment and let us know.

What we will be posting here:
1) hosted checkout integration code and guide
2) hosted checkout user journey templates and guide
